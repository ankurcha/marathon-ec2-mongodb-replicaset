## Ochothon flask sample

### Overview

This project is a simple [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) container definition that can be launched on
[**DCOS from Mesosphere**](https://mesosphere.com/). It illustrates how our [**Ochopod**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochothon)
technology can be used to manage [**Zookeeper 3.4.6**](http://zookeeper.apache.org) and automatically configure it
into a functional ensemble.


### Deploy it !

Make sure you have [**DCOS**](https://mesosphere.com/) setup over EC2. Then simply blast our little application JSON
payload to one of your masters. For instance:

```
$ curl -s -XPOST http://<YOUR MASTER IP>:8080/v2/apps -d@dcos.json -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Wait a bit for the image to be pulled and you will end up with a 3 nodes ensemble ! You can scale your
[**Marathon**](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) task up and down and Ochopod will re-configure your ensemble !

Please note the JSON definition used for this example is not binding TCP 2181 to the host machine so you will have to
see what port it has been remapped to if you want for instance to use this ensemble or send 4-letters commands.

Once you are done playing you can simply destroy the *zookeeper-sample* application.
